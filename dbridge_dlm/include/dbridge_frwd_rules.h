*    \brief The file implements the CM Forwarding Rules:
*
*  1)CM Pre-Operational
*   - The CM MUST NOT send any DHCPv4 DHCPDISCOVER or DHCPREQUEST, DHCPv6 Solicit or Request,
*     TFTP-RRQ, HTTP Request, Time Protocol Request, or IPv6 Router Solicitation messages to any interface
*     except the RF Interface;
*
*   - The CM MUST NOT accept any DHCPv4 DHCPOFFER or DHCPACK, DHCPv6 Advertise or Reply, TFTPDATA,
*     HTTP Response, Time Protocol Response, or IPv6 Router Advertisements from the CMCI ports;
*
*  2)CM Operational
*   - Forwarding of frames received from any CPE port conforms to the following specific rules:
*     The CM MUST NOT accept any DHCPv4 DHCPOFFER or DHCPACK, DHCPv6 Advertise or Reply, TFTPDATA,
*     HTTP Response, Time Protocol Response, or IPv6 Router Advertisements from any of the CPE ports
*     for the purposes of configuration, secure software download, or address renewal.
*
*   - Forwarding of frames being sent by the CM IP stack conforms to the following specific rules:
*     The CM MUST NOT forward any DHCPv4 DHCPDISCOVER or DHCPREQUEST, DHCPv6 Solicit or
*     Request, TFTP-RRQ, HTTP Request, Time Protocol Request, or Router Solicitation messages to any ports
*     except the RF port.
